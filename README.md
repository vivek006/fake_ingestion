# Running the Pipeline Locally

This guide provides instructions on how to run the fake ingestion pipeline on your local machine using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: You need Docker to build and run the containerized pipeline. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven't already.

- **Bash**: The script uses Bash commands, so you need a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows).

## Steps to Run the Pipeline Locally

Follow these steps to run the pipeline on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

First, make sure you have cloned the repository containing the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone fake_ingestion cd fake_ingestion
```

### To run the pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
bash ./run_pipeline.sh
```
