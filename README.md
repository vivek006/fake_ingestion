# Running the Pipeline Locally

This guide provides instructions on how to run the fake ingestion pipeline on your local machine using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: You need Docker to build and run the containerized pipeline. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven't already.

- **Bash**: The script uses Bash commands, so you need a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows).

## Steps to Run the Pipeline Locally

Follow these steps to run the pipeline on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

First, make sure you have cloned the repository containing the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone fake_ingestion cd fake_ingestion
```

### To run the pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
bash ./run_pipeline.sh
```

## Changes to Make for Production-Readiness

1. **Database Upgrade**:
   - Replace SQLite with a production-grade database for scalability and support for concurrent connections.

2. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Modularize the pipeline into operator/packages.
   - Use environment variables and configuration files instead of hardcoded values for easier management across environments.

3. **Error Handling and Retries**:
   - Implement robust error handling and retry logic using tools like Backoff (which is already in place), along with native retries in Airflow/Prefect.
   - Set up dead-letter queues for failed tasks and store error logs in a central system for debugging.
   - For critical tasks, ensure alerting (via Slack, PagerDuty, etc.) is in place to notify the team when issues arise.

4. **Automated Testing and CI/CD**:
   - Set up a CI pipeline to run unit, integration, and build tests on code changes.
   - Implement a CD pipeline for automatic deployment to staging and production after tests pass.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement a logging framework to centralize logs (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK Stack).
   - Set up alerts for critical failures and performance metrics.

6. **Security**:
   - Secure sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) using environment variables or secret management systems.



## System Design for a Production-Ready Pipeline

### High-Level Overview

When moving a data processing pipeline to production, the approach needs to evolve to handle scaling, fault tolerance, security, and monitoring. Hereâ€™s an overview of how I would approach making this pipeline production-ready:

1. **Orchestration and Scheduling**
   - Apache Airflow to build complex workflows, manage dependencies, and handle retries in case of failures.
   - Manage scheduling for periodic runs, such as daily or hourly.

2. **Infrastructure and Deployment**
   - Dockerize the pipeline for consistent environments.
   - Use Kubernetes for scaling, failover, and scheduling.
   - Host on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - Automate testing and deployment with CI/CD tools.

3. **Storage**
   - Transition from SQLite to a production-grade database.

4. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**
   - Implement robust error handling and retry logic in Airflow/Prefect.
   - For critical tasks, ensure alerting is in place to notify the team when issues arise.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Use Datadog and Grafana to monitor pipeline performance, resource usage, and job status.
   - Implement dashboards to monitor job successes, failures, and execution times.

6. **Security and Compliance**
   - Secure sensitive user data during processing by ensuring encryption both at rest and in transit.
   - Implement ACL to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations in place.
